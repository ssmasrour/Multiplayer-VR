# Multiplayer-VR

This is a networked Virtual Reality project for Unity that I used Alteruna for the multiplayer part (though can be replaced with Fusion, Nakama, Mirror, etc.).<br>
It can be use as a starter template or give this repo some star in order make me eager me to develop it into a first person shooter game in my spare time.
